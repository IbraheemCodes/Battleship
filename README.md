This game can be played by users gussing the location of the computers battleship in a 6 row by 5 colums.


There are 3 difficulties ;


-Standard

-Veteran

-Near Impossible


## How to play

First the user has to enter Username and then 2 boards are generated.

The water is resembled with a ðŸŒŠ emoji and the ship is resembled with a ðŸš¢.

Once the ship is attacked it will show a ðŸ’¥ emoji and if missed, it will show a ðŸ”¥ emoji.

Whoever takes out the opponents Ships first wins ther game.

## Data Model

I have chosen Board as a model as it is a great example that has the features insides aligned and intact such as water and ships. It even appears visibly appealing and with the Emojis it increases the looks instead of a dot and cross method.

I can add and remove the size of the board and it will stay perfectly in position. 

## Errors

There were a few issues such as both of the boards have the ships visible which is wrong as the user should only see their own ships on board and not the Bots.

## Testing and Validation

I have tested this Terminal through multiple ways

- Tested through PEP8 linter with only issue being line too long which i cannot resolve
